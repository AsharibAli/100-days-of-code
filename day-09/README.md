# Day-09 of `100-Days-Of-Code` Challenge

**Q25** - Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

- Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

- Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

**Q26** - Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain.

- If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.

- If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.

- Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.

**Q27** - Alien Colors #3: Turn your if-else chain from Exercise 5-4 into an if-else chain.
-  If the alien is green, print a message that the player earned 5 points.

- If the alien is yellow, print a message that the player earned 10 points.

- If the alien is red, print a message that the player earned 15 points.

- Write three versions of this program, making sure each message is printed for the appropriate color alien.
