# Day-05 of `100-Days-Of-Code` Challenge

**Q13** - Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

**Q14** - Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

**Q15** - Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of someone else to invite:

- Start with your program from Exercise 14. Add a print statement at the end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.

- Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of the new person you are inviting.

- Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list.
