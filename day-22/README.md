# Day-22 of `100-Days-Of-Code` Challenge

**Q64** - Combine Strings and Numbers: Write a function that merges a piece of text with a number. For example, if provided with "Age: " and 30, it should give back "Age: 30".

**Q65** - Determine the Remainder: Make a function that gets two numbers and shows the leftover from dividing them using the `%` sign. For example, `remainder(5, 2)` should give `1`.

**Q66** - Logical AND Verification: Create a function that checks two boolean (true or false) values. It should only say `true` if both are true, using the `&&` operator. For instance, `checkBothTrue(true, false)` should be `false`.
