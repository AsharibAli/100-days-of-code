**Q46** - Enhanced Laptop Object: Construct an object for a laptop including properties make, model, year, and a method describe() that logs a sentence about the laptop.

**Q47** - Array Destructuring: Given an array of objects representing different laptops, each with properties `make`, `model`, and `year`, use array destructuring to assign the first and second laptops to variables. Then, log these variables.

**Q48** - Combining Arrays with Spread Operator: Suppose you're comparing prices of two different sets of laptops. Use the spread operator to combine these arrays into a single array sorted in ascending order, then log the result.
