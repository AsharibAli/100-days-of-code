// Demonstrates using console.log() inside a loop to track variable values
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(`Iteration ${i}, i value:, i`); // Logs the current iteration number and the value of i
}
// This loop iterates five times, logging the value of 'i' during each iteration to help with debugging.
