# Day-25 of `100-Days-Of-Code` Challenge

**Question 73:** Assigning and Updating Variables: Create a function where you declare a variable using let and assign an initial value. Then, update its value within the same function and log both the initial and updated values.

**Question 74:** Swapping Variables: Demonstrate how to swap the values of two variables. Start with variables `a = 5` and `b = 10`, then swap their values so that `a` becomes `10` and `b` becomes `5`.

**Question 75:** Compound Assignment Operators: Use compound assignment operators to simplify arithmetic operations. Start with `x = 4` and perform a series of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on `x` using compound operators.
