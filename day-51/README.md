Alhamdulillah, we've successfully completed 50 days of the 100-day coding challenge, meaning we are 50% done. For the remaining days, I propose a new approach to deepen our understanding of programming and web fundamentals.

I've realized that a strong grasp of the basics is essential for understanding how things work behind the scenes, implementing projects, and more. Therefore, starting from day 51, I will share a daily video or article focusing on technical concepts. This will help build your logic and enhance your ability to apply these concepts to your projects.

Your task is simple:
Each day, thoroughly read the article or watch the video I send. If it includes coding exercises, please complete them. I will ensure the materials are both high-quality and concise, so you can learn something valuable each day.

I'm confident this will greatly improve your performance and understanding of the underlying processes in coding.

Remember, becoming a successful developer/engineer involves more than just coding. It's about understanding the fundamentals. That’s why I’ve decided to take this step.

While there are many benefits to this approach, I won’t go into all of them here. However, I believe you will find it very beneficial in various ways.

Please share what you learn on LinkedIn and commit your code (if applicable) to GitHub. This allows us as instructors to see your progress and what new concepts you've grasped.

Thank you,
Asharib Ali
