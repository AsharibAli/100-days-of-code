**Q38** - Cities: Write a function called describe_city() that accepts the name of a city and its country. The function should print a simple sentence, such as Karachi is in Pakistan. Give the parameter for the country a default value. Call your function for three different cities, at least one of which is not in the default country.

**Q39** - City Names: Write a function called city_country() that takes in the name of a city and its country. The function should return a string formatted like this:
